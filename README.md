## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Coloring images was a challenge during this project. After looking through stackoverflow enough, I found out that by using the commands to create a linear gradient and to hide overflow that I could color the image roughly as it appears in the original design to code towards.
The code for the mobile appearance is messy as I only wrote it after the code for how it would appear on desktop, so more time put into planning that would have likely made it more efficient.

### Continued development

Overall with this code challenge, I mostly did things as I went so the code ended up less clean than it
could have been. In future projects, I will spend more time planning out how exactly I want to code sections.

### Useful resources

- [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) - This is the course I am using to learn web development right now, and I found Frontend Mentor by looking at the extra resources for practice in the course files.
